	<h1> Adoption </h1>
	
	<h4> Requirements </h4>
	
		<h3>PAWS New Zealand ensures that all healthy animals coming into our care are offered for adoption to homes that we consider acceptable and will be suitable for the animal.  
			By adopting an animal from PAWS you’ll be providing a new home to an animal who desperately needs your love.

			All our animals have undergone a behavioral assessment.  
			Their temperament is thoroughly evaluated to ensure that they will be adopted into homes that will best suit both the animals and the new owners. 

			PAWS maintains a strict policy on desexing and we neuter both adult male and female cats and dogs prior to adoption.  
			Puppies that are not neutered at the time of adoption will come with a desexing voucher that must be redeemed before the expiry date.  This policy is strictly enforced as our contribution towards reducing the number of surplus unwanted animals.</h3>

	<h4> Pet Care Advice </h4>
		<h3> Choosing to have a pet in your life is a lifelong commitment. Most pets are wholly dependent on their owners for their quality of life. It is important to ensure you can properly care for your pet and understand your pet's needs.

			Animals don't just need food and water, they need appropriate shelter and living space, regular vet check-ups and preventative vet care to ensure they remain happy and healthy. Just as importantly, your pet needs you: your time, love and attention. 
			Many pets need mental stimulation and regular exercise to prevent them from becoming bored or overweight. </h3>
